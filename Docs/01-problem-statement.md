# AI-Assisted Compliance Review System for Enterprise Documents

## Problem Statement

Large enterprises handle thousands of unstructured documents daily, such as vendor contracts, compliance reports, policy documents, and regulatory submissions.  
Manual review of these documents is slow, inconsistent, and highly dependent on human expertise, leading to increased compliance risk, delayed decisions, and operational inefficiencies.

Existing automation solutions often rely on rigid rule-based systems that fail to scale across document types or adapt to regulatory changes.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a **cloud-native, event-driven AI system** that ingests enterprise documents, extracts relevant information, classifies document intent, identifies compliance risks, and produces structured, explainable recommendations.

The system is designed to assist human reviewers — not replace them — by prioritizing documents, highlighting risks, and reducing manual effort.

## Key Outcomes

- Automated document ingestion and processing
- AI-assisted classification and risk analysis
- Explainable decision outputs with confidence scores
- Scalable, asynchronous cloud architecture
- Audit-friendly and observable pipeline design

## Non-Goals

- This system does not make legally binding decisions
- No direct integration with external enterprise systems in Phase 1
- No real personal or confidential data is used
